# Chapter 6: Multicat
In reality, single-class classifiers are not all that common - and images often relate to no, or mutliple classes. 
Pandas and its [DataFrames](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) became useful tools in this chapter, 
to access rows and columns. 
## DataBlocks
**Tip**: Do not use Python lambdas if exporting the Learner. 
A DataBlock can be craeted using a Pandas DataFrame. When creating the DataBlocks, ensure:
- the dependent variables are split on the space character
- the dependent variable has a full file path
An example from the DataBlocks created in this chapter is as follows:
```python
dls.show_batch(nrows=1, ncols=3)
```

## Binary Cross-Entropy
To get the mini-batch, pass it onto a model, and look at the activations, binary cross-entropy is required. 
This is because nll_loss/softmax cannot be used on a one-hot-encoded dependent variable; softmax pushes one activation
to be significantly larger than the others and nll_loss returns the value of one activation.
## Regression
Image regression is where the independent variable is an image, and the dependent variable is one or more floating point numbers.
The key point model is used to reference a specific location within an image using a *key point*.
As a result of this learning, a model could be developed to accurately predict the centre of a man's head using deep learning, as seen below.
