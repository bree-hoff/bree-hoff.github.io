# Chapter 17: Neural Net Foundations

## Chapters 13-16
I worked through Chapters 13-16 independently of the blog, and as such, I am picking up from Chapter 17: A Neural Net from Foundations.

## Building a Neural Net From Scratch
The Neural Net is constructed by:
- Modelling a neuron
- Performing matrix multiplication from scratch
- Performing elementwise arithmetic
- Broadcasting
- The Einstein Summation
- Forward and Backward Passes
As no fun and exciting figures were included in this chapter, I have elected to exclude code snippets from this blog.
The code all ran smoothly, and it was interesting to see how the neural net is essentially a lot of matrix multiplications with nonlinearities in-between. Elementwise arithmetic and broadcasting can be deemed necessary due to how slow Python is. Kaiming initialization
was used to get training started, since we had ReLU nonlinearities.

Apologies for the short blog post, thanks for reading!
