# Concluding Statements
This fast.ai course has been very digestable, easy-to-follow, and very comprehensive. The data and information is inticing and I am excited to apply the techniques and information I have learnt to a variety of real-world applications. I will note that the time taken for importing fastbook at the start of each lesson was suboptimal, however; the Google Colab format made the learnings much more enthralling. 

Thank you for reading my blog, and I have had an absolute joy making it.
