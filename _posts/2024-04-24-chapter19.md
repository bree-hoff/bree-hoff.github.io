# Chapter 19: Learner

## Chapter 18
I worked through Chapters 18 independently of the blog, and as such, I am picking up from Chapter 19: A Fastai Learner from Scratch.

## Building a fastai Learner From Scratch
The Neural Net is constructed by:
- Modelling a neuron
- Performing matrix multiplication from scratch
- Performing elementwise arithmetic
- Broadcasting
- The Einstein Summation
- Forward and Backward Passes
As no fun and exciting figures were included in this chapter, I have elected to exclude code snippets from this blog.
The code all ran smoothly, and it was interesting to see how the neural net is essentially a lot of matrix multiplications with nonlinearities in-between. Elementwise arithmetic and broadcasting can be deemed necessary due to how slow Python is. Kaiming initialization
was used to get training started, since we had ReLU nonlinearities.

Apologies for the short blog post, thanks for reading!

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `filename` is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. `.md` is the file extension for markdown files.

The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a "*level 1 heading*" in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line `## File names` above.

## Basic formatting

You can use *italics*, **bold**, `code font text`, and create [links](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). Here's a footnote [^1]. Here's a horizontal rule:

## Lists

Here's a list:

- item 1
- item 2

And a numbered list:

1. item 1
1. item 2

## Boxes and stuff

> This is a quotation

{% include alert.html text="You can include alert boxes" %}

...and...

{% include info.html text="You can include info boxes" %}

## Images

![](/images/logo.png "fast.ai's logo")

## Code

General preformatted text:

    # Do a thing
    do_thing()

Python code and output:

```python
# Prints '2'
print(1+1)
```

    2

## Tables

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|-|-|
| A thing | Another thing |
