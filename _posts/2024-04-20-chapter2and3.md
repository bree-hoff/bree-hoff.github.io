# Chapters 2 - 3: Production and Ethics 
## Chapter 2: Production
### Setting Up
The set-up of the Google Colab Jupyter Notebook from [the fastai website](https://course.fast.ai/Resources/book.html) was extremely easy,
though signing up for the Microsoft Azure account was a bit of a pain. From first impressions, the notebook is well formatted and laid-out,
easy to follow and very interactive - everything looks great thus far. 
### Background on Deep Learning
Chapter 2 begins by providing a background on Deep Learning. This introduction serves to remind users to maintain an open mind - 
that underestimating the constraints and capabilities of deep learning can be problematic, and sometimes the solution is simpler or less-complex
than one might expect.\
Computer vision is highlighted as a major field in which deep learning can assist - namely, object recognition and detection (e.g. in radiology). Other uses of deep learning are noted as natural language processing, like Google's online translation system, combining words and images, like sending high priority alerts from CT scans, or tabular data, like recommendation systems on sites like Amazon.  
However, deep learning is faulted in that its models generally can't recognise or detect images or objects that are not used in its training 
data. This can be counteracted to some degree using *data augmentation*. A further limitation highlighted is the ability for the model to offer helpful, rather than just liked, recommendations to the user. 
### Drivetrain Approach
The course delves into the Drivetrain Approach, an approach used to develop a deep learning model that is practically useful. The model 
requires the following steps:
1. Defined objective - what are we trying to achieve?
2. Levers - what inputs can we control?
3. Data - what data can we collect?
4. Models - how do the levers influence the data?  
This approach encourages consideration of how the model can benefit the overall system, based on experimental data.

## Chapter 3 Ethics
### Recourse Processes, Feedback Loops, Bias
Bugs in software models, like that in the Healthcare Benefit algorithm example, dangerous feedback loops, like Youtube's conspiracy theory feedback loop and damaging bias, like that of Latanya Sweeney's racially-biased arrest ads, can have serious ethical consequences. It was interesting to consider that one may be involved in a large-scale data science project, which unbeknownst to them, might actually be supporting a problematic, negative regime. Equally, there is potential for this technology and its benefits to go towards positive change, for a data scientist to contribute to ground-breaking technology that may revolutionize fields like medicine.
### Solutions
This course highlights the requirement for audit and error correction mechanisms, as well as holding some degree of accountability over our own machine learning developments. As developers, it is important to break unhelpful or problematic feedback loops as soon as they are detected in our algorithm - to avoid, in extreme examples, pushing political agendas or shaping home videos into content for pedophiles.
Due to bias (i.e. measurement bias, agreggation bias and representation bias) in datasets being so pervasive, this should be counteracted via more diverse datasets, but largely should be mitigated by only specifying the scenario for the model for which it has been tested.




Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `filename` is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. `.md` is the file extension for markdown files.

The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a "*level 1 heading*" in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line `## File names` above.

## Basic formatting

You can use *italics*, **bold**, `code font text`, and create [links](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). Here's a footnote [^1]. Here's a horizontal rule:

## Lists

Here's a list:

- item 1
- item 2

And a numbered list:

1. item 1
1. item 2

## Boxes and stuff

> This is a quotation

{% include alert.html text="You can include alert boxes" %}

...and...

{% include info.html text="You can include info boxes" %}

## Images

![](/images/logo.png "fast.ai's logo")

## Code

General preformatted text:

    # Do a thing
    do_thing()

Python code and output:

```python
# Prints '2'
print(1+1)
```

    2

## Tables

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|-|-|
| A thing | Another thing |
